# M100 - MongoDB for SQL Pros
Learn how to map your relational databases knowledge to MongoDB.

## Concepts of RDBMS and MongoDB
- [NoSQL by mongoDB Engineer][noSQL]
    - Families:
        - Key/Value (Redis, Dynamo, memcached)
        - Graph (Neo4j, RedisGraph, Amazon Neptune)
        - Column (Apache Cassandra, Bigtable)
            - Better for analytics
        - Document (MongoDB, Elasticsearch)

### Database Terminology:

#### RDBMS Database vs. MongoDB Database
A traditional relational database is a set of tables.
MongoDB is a set of collections.

#### RDBMS Table vs. MongoDB Collection
A table is a set of rows, while a MongoDB collection is a set of documents.

#### RDBMS Parent-Child Tables vs. MongoDB Nested Sub-Document or Array
A table has a relationship to other tables, relations like one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many by linking attributes from both tables.

MongoDB can express the relationships between collections similarly. However, MongoDB has an additional feature, the ability to take the fields of child table and embed it with the parent table as a single collection.

This grouping leads to a data model with far fewer collections than the number of tables in the corresponding relational model.

#### RDBMS Index vs. MongoDB Index
In RDBMS, indexes are built on any number of columns in a table.

In MongoDB, because there is far less need to bring data together, indexes are mainly used for filtering and sorting, rarely for joining. This leads to lower memory usage for indexes.

Building an index on a set of fields in a collection is the equivalent of having an index that would be built on a set of tables.

And as for traditional relational databases, indexes in MongoDB are also the most important thing to look for to ensure excellent performance.

#### RDBMS Row vs. MongoDB Document
A row in a traditional relational database maps to a document in MongoDB.

However, a document is self-descriptive. A document includes the names of the columns for which it has data.

#### RDBMS Column vs. MongoDB Field
A column of a table translates to a field of a document.

The main difference is that each document can have a different list of fields, allowing for documents with different shapes (polymorphism) in a collection.

#### RDBMS Join vs. MongoDB Embedding, Linking, or $lookup
Joins are used in a relational database to get data from two or more tables.

With MongoDB, there is a $lookup operator to perform the same link between collections.

Additionally, some relationships are also expressed by embedding the child table in the parent table. For these relationship, there is no need to use the $lookup keyword, as the data is already pre-joined in the document. The document model makes things much natural and queries so much simpler.

#### RDBMS View vs. MongoDB Read-Only View or On-Demand Materialized View
Relational views are also available in MongoDB and are also called views.
RDBMS Multi-Record ACID Transaction vs. MongoDB Multi-Document ACID Transaction

Finally, the transactions you are used to in a traditional relational database are also available and named the same way in MongoDB. The code that uses MongoDB transactions is remarkably similar to what you are used to with a traditional relational database.

Because MongoDB can store data in one document that is traditionally stored across rows in different tables, the need for transactions is much less than in relational systems.

#### SQL/RDBMS Refreshers
Note that the following refreshers about SQL/RDBMS cover topics that are also applicable to MongoDB.

- [ACID][ACID]
    - [Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability][ACID]
- High Availability
    - Ability to support applications through a group of servers to minimize down time.
- Replication
    - Keeping many copies of each data piece on different servers by replicating the data to achieve high availability and fault tolerance

### Document Model
- [MongoDB Documentation on the Document Model][documentModel]
- [BSON Specification][bsonSpec]
- [Developer Autonomy and the Document Model][AutonomyAndDocumentModel]
- Structure:
    - fields (attributes)
    - sub-documents (nested documents or Objects)
    - arrays

Example:

![Array](/images/m100-document-model-01.png ':size=300xHEIGHT')

### [ACID][ACID] with Transactions and Documents
ACID:
- Atomicity
    - Transactions are all or nothing
- Consistency
    - Only valid data is saved
- Isolation
    - Transactions do not affect each other
- Durability
    - Written data will not be lost

- [MongoDB documentation on read preferences][readPreference]
- [Creating manually global clusters with zone sharding][zoneSharding]
