# M100 - MongoDB for SQL Pros
Learn how to map your relational databases knowledge to MongoDB.

## Concepts of RDBMS and MongoDB
- [NoSQL by mongoDB Engineer][noSQL]
    - Families:
        - Key/Value (Redis, Dynamo, memcached)
        - Graph (Neo4j, RedisGraph, Amazon Neptune)
        - Column (Apache Cassandra, Bigtable)
            - Better for analytics
        - Document (MongoDB, Elasticsearch)

### Database Terminology:

#### RDBMS Database vs. MongoDB Database
A traditional relational database is a set of tables.
MongoDB is a set of collections.

#### RDBMS Table vs. MongoDB Collection
A table is a set of rows, while a MongoDB collection is a set of documents.

#### RDBMS Parent-Child Tables vs. MongoDB Nested Sub-Document or Array
A table has a relationship to other tables, relations like one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many by linking attributes from both tables.

MongoDB can express the relationships between collections similarly. However, MongoDB has an additional feature, the ability to take the fields of child table and embed it with the parent table as a single collection.

This grouping leads to a data model with far fewer collections than the number of tables in the corresponding relational model.

#### RDBMS Index vs. MongoDB Index
In RDBMS, indexes are built on any number of columns in a table.

In MongoDB, because there is far less need to bring data together, indexes are mainly used for filtering and sorting, rarely for joining. This leads to lower memory usage for indexes.

Building an index on a set of fields in a collection is the equivalent of having an index that would be built on a set of tables.

And as for traditional relational databases, indexes in MongoDB are also the most important thing to look for to ensure excellent performance.

#### RDBMS Row vs. MongoDB Document
A row in a traditional relational database maps to a document in MongoDB.

However, a document is self-descriptive. A document includes the names of the columns for which it has data.

#### RDBMS Column vs. MongoDB Field
A column of a table translates to a field of a document.

The main difference is that each document can have a different list of fields, allowing for documents with different shapes (polymorphism) in a collection.

#### RDBMS Join vs. MongoDB Embedding, Linking, or $lookup
Joins are used in a relational database to get data from two or more tables.

With MongoDB, there is a $lookup operator to perform the same link between collections.

Additionally, some relationships are also expressed by embedding the child table in the parent table. For these relationship, there is no need to use the $lookup keyword, as the data is already pre-joined in the document. The document model makes things much natural and queries so much simpler.

#### RDBMS View vs. MongoDB Read-Only View or On-Demand Materialized View
Relational views are also available in MongoDB and are also called views.
RDBMS Multi-Record ACID Transaction vs. MongoDB Multi-Document ACID Transaction

Finally, the transactions you are used to in a traditional relational database are also available and named the same way in MongoDB. The code that uses MongoDB transactions is remarkably similar to what you are used to with a traditional relational database.

Because MongoDB can store data in one document that is traditionally stored across rows in different tables, the need for transactions is much less than in relational systems.

#### SQL/RDBMS Refreshers
Note that the following refreshers about SQL/RDBMS cover topics that are also applicable to MongoDB.

- [ACID][ACID]
    - [Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability][ACID]
- High Availability
    - Ability to support applications through a group of servers to minimize down time.
- Replication
    - Keeping many copies of each data piece on different servers by replicating the data to achieve high availability and fault tolerance

### Document Model
- [MongoDB Documentation on the Document Model][documentModel]
- [BSON Specification][bsonSpec]
- [Developer Autonomy and the Document Model][AutonomyAndDocumentModel]
- Structure:
    - fields (attributes)
    - sub-documents (nested documents or Objects)
    - arrays

Example:

![Array](/images/m100-document-model-01.png ':size=300xHEIGHT')

### ACID with Transactions and Documents
ACID:
- Atomicity
    - Transactions are all or nothing
- Consistency
    - Only valid data is saved
- Isolation
    - Transactions do not affect each other
- Durability
    - Written data will not be lost
- [More about ACID and transactions in MongoDB][videoACID]

### Read/Writes Operation Guarantees

- [MongoDB documentation on read concerns][readConcern]
- [MongoDB documentation on read preferences][readPreference]
- [Creating manually global clusters with zone sharding][zoneSharding]


## Modeling for MongoDB
### Flexible Methodology for Data Modeling
- Workload (Size data, quantify ops, and qualify ops)
    - Understand what operations are modeling for
    - Quantify and qualify read and write operations
    - Outputs, list of operations which of these are the most important
- Relationships (identify, quantify and embed or link)
    - Similar to relational modeling:
        - One-to-one
        - One-to-many
        - Many-to-many
    - Choose between: embed in same document reference/link documents
- Patterns (recognize and apply)
    - Transformations, address performance, maintenance, or simplicity requirements

### Embedding vs Referencing
The anti-pattern of using [massive arrays][massiveArrays]

Default rule, prefer embedding over referencing, for better performance.

- Embedding
    - No need foreign key
    - No need integrity check
    - Cascading deletes implicit
- Linking/Referencing
    - Similar to 2 tables in RDBMS
    - Use $lookup to join the documents
    - Use a subsequent query for the second collection

Constraints Rules:
    - Reference:
        - If the "many" side of the one-to-many or many-to-many relationship is a huge number.
        - If one piece if frequently used but not the other one, where the physical memory of the machine is an issue.

Integrity Rules:
    - Embed:
        - read operations
        - write operations one-to-one and one-to-many relationships
    - Reference
        - write operations on many-to-many relationships

Data expiration Rules:
    - Embed:
        - data that is deleted together at a given time

### Schema Design Patterns
- [Blogs on Schema Design Patterns][blogSchemaDesignPatterns]
- [Blogs on Schema Design Anti-Patterns][blogSchemaDesignAntiPatterns]

### Schema validation
- [JSON keywords supported in MongoDB validators][JSONMongoDBValidators]

- Validation with an RDBMS
    - Ensure field exists
    - Ensure fields are non-null
    - Ensure fields have a type
    - Restrict to a set of values
- Validation with mongoDB
    - JSON Schema
    - Extends Standard JSON to support BSON types
        - Required fields
        - Required types
        - Required values
    - Validate new documents or modified documents
    - Report warnings or errors

### Sharding
[Good explanation of sharding][goodSharding]

### Data Integrity
- RDBMS
    - Entity integrity
    - Referential integrity
    - Domain integrity
    - User-defined integrity
- MongoDB
    - **Entity integrity**: Entities have a unique Primary Key
        - named _id
        - Unique compound indexes
    - **Referential integrity**: Foreign key integrity
        - No support across collections
        - No foreign keys in relationship modeled by embedding
        - No need for cascading deletes with single document
    - **Domain integrity**: Data is restricted to a type and set of values
        - Socument validation with JSON Schema
        - Join with other collection using $lookup
    - **User-defined integrity**: Any, automatically triggered upon changes
        - Change Streams on write operations
        - Atlas triggers


## Code and Queries

### Query Languages

**MQL (MongoDB Query Lenguage), Aggregation Framework**
- MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines need to be interpreted from the top-to-bottom as each stage impacts the following stage. You need to be aware of all of the stages to understand the complete logic of the query.
- MongoDB Aggregations uses sequential stages.
- The document in MongoDB often corresponds to the desired object so it can be sent directly without processing.

![MQL-Advanced](/images/m100-mql-advanced-aggregations.png ':size=50%xHEIGHT')

**SQL, Declarative queries**
- A SQL SELECT statement needs to be interpreted from the inside-out to understand the logic of the query.
- SQL uses sequential statements without nesting. Rather it uses nested statements for queries.
- SQL uses nested statements for queries.
- An Object Mapper typically gathers data from multiple tables or collections to create the single object. The joining and processing of data from various tables can be quite impactful in a relational database.

![SQL-Declarative](/images/m100-sql-declarative-queries.png ':size=50%xHEIGHT')

**Reference table to translate between SQL terms, functions, and concepts into the equivalent in terms of MongoDB Query Language.**

| SQL        | MongoDB Aggregation Framework       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| SELECT     | db.aggregate() or db.find()         |
| WHERE      | $match or db.find({ field: value }) |
| GROUP      | $group                              |
| COUNT      | $count or db.count()                |
| LIMIT, TOP | $limit or db.limit()                |
| ORDER BY   | $sort or db.sort()                  |
| JOIN       | $lookup                             |
| UNION ALL  | $unionWith                          |


## The Life Cycle of an Application and Additional Resources

### Providing High Availability
High Availability (HA) is defined as the capacity to service operations even in the event of failures or planned downtime.
[Adding/Replacing Server][addOrReplaceServer]
[Changing hostname or IP / SRV record/DNS Seedlist][SRVrecordOrDNSSeedlist]
[Scaling Horizontally or Sharding][Sharding]

### Server Maintenance MongoDB
- No need to plan a downtime window.
- Elections of a new Primary node are automatic in MongoDB.
- Retryable writes are one of the great features of MongoDB. Retryable writes can overcome most temporary hiccups in the cluster and the network. From a maintenance point of view, they help do a smooth transition from one Primary node to a new Primary node.
- Automatic scaling in MongoDB Atlas.

### Schema Migration MongoDB
- Because documents in the same collection can have different shapes, we can have documents with the original schema and documents with the new schema. Instead of seeing the migration as an atomic operation, it becomes a continuous process throughout the migration.
- Each document can carry its schema version number. Using a schema version to identify the shape of the document is optional. The alternative is to deduce the version of the schema by the differences in the fields. Both approaches highlight the fact that each document must respect one of the schema versions for our collection.
