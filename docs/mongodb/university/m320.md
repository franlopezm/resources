# M320 - Data Modeling
Learn everything you need to know about data modeling for MongoDB.

## Introduction to Data Modeling
### The document model in MongoDB
- MongoDB stores data as Documents. [Document structure][documentStructure]
- Document fields can be values, embedded documents, or arrays of values and documents.
- MongoDB is a flexive Schema database.
- MongoDB documents are stored as BSON documents.
- [Supported datatypes][supportDatatypes]

Example:

```json
{
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "age": 25,
    "address": {
        "city": "Capitol",
        "state": "Moosylvania",
        "street": "One"
    },
    "phones": [
        "987654123", "389748323"
    ]
}
```


### Constraints in data modeling

- Keep the frequently used Documents in RAM
- Keep the Indexes in RAM
- Prefer SSD to HDD
- Infrequently data can use HDD
- The nature of your dataset and hardware define the need to model your data
  - It is important to identify those exact constraints and their impact to create a better model
  - As your software and the technological landscape change, your model should be re-evaluated and updated accordingly.
- Avoid [Transactions][transactions]
  - [Transactions videos][transactionVideos]

### Identifying the workload
- Quantify and qualify the queries as much as you can.
- Few CRUD operations will drive the design.

Examples of data with their desired durability

| Type of data                      | Durability      | MongoDB notation |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Money                             | majority        | w=majority       |
| Account information               | majority        | w=majority       |
| ...anything that you can't lose   | majority        | w=majority       |
| Log data                          | one node        | w=1              |
| Sensor data                       | one node        | w=1              |
| Stock quotes, few per second data | fire and forget | w=0              |



## Relationships
### Types and Cardinality
- Common Relationships
  - one to one (1-1)
  - one to many (1-N)
  - many to many (N-N)
  - one to zillions (1-[minimum, likely, maximum]) Used in Big data.

### One to Many
- Embed
  - in the "one" side
    - The documents from the "many" side are embedded
    - Most common representation for: simple applications or few documents to embed
    - Need to process main object and the N related documents together
    - Indexing is done on the array
  - in the "many" side
    - Less often used
    - Useful if "many" side is queried more often than the "one" side
    - Embedded object is duplicated, duplication may be preferable for dynamic objects
  - Usually, embedding in the entity the most queried
- Reference
  - in the "one" side
    - Array of references
    - Allows for large documents and a high count of these
    - List of references available when retrieving the main object
    - Cascade deletes are not supported by MongoDB and must be managed by the application
  - in the "many" side
    - Preferred representation using references
    - Allows for large documents and a high count of these
    - No need to manage the references on the "one" side.
  - Usually, referencing in the "many" side

### Many to Many
- Embed
  - Array of subdocuments in the "many" side
    - The documents from the less queried side are embedded
    - Results in duplication
    - Keep "source" for the embedded documents in another collection
    - Indexing is done on the array
  - Array of subdocuments in the other "many" side
  - Usually, only the most queried side is considered
  - Prefer embedding on the most queried side
  - Prefer embedding for information that is primarily static over time and may profit from duplication
- Reference
  - Array of references in one "many" side
    - Array of references to the documents of the other collection
    - References readily available upon first query on the "main" collection
  - Array of references in the other "many" side
    - Array of references to the documents of the other collection
    - Need a second query to get more information
  - Prefer referencing over embedding to avoid managing duplication

### One to One
- Prefer embedding over referencing for simplicity
- Embed
  - Fields at same level
  - Grouping in sub-documents
- Reference
  - Same identifier in both documents
  - In the main "one" side
  - In the secondary "one" side
  - Add complexity
  - Possible performance improvements with:
    - smaller disk access
    - smaller amount of RAM needed

### One to Zillions
- Reference
  - in the "many/zillions" side


## Patterns
More about [BSON Types][bsonTypes] and [JSON Schema][jsonSchema].

### Handling Duplication, Staleness and Integrity
These are the three most important concepts:

- Handling Duplication
  - Duplicatin data across documents
  - Why?
    - Result of embedding information in a given document for faster access.
  - Concern?
    - Challenge for correctness and consistency.
- Handling Staleness
  - Accepting staleness in some pieces of data
  - Why?
    - New events come along at such a rate that updating some data constantly causes performance issues.
  - Concern?
    - Data quality and reliability
- Handling Referential Integrity
  - Writing extra application side logic to ensure referencial integrity
  - Why?
    - Linking information between documents or tables.
    - No support for cascading deletes
  - Concern?
    - Challenge for correctness and consistency

For a given piece of data:
- Should or could the information be duplicated or not?
  - Resolve with bulk updates
- What is the tolerated or acceptable staleness?
  - Resolve with updates bases on [change streams][changeStreams]
- Which pieces of data require referential integrity?
  - Resolve or prevent the inconsistencies with [change streams][changeStreams] or transactions

### Attribute Pattern
Orthogonal pattern to polymorphism

- Problem
  - Lots of similar fields
  - Want to search across many fields at once
  - Fields present in only a small subset of documents
- Solution
  - Break the field/value into a sub-document with:
    - fieldA: field
    - fieldB: value
  - Example:
    - from `{ color: "blue", size: "large" }`
    - to `[{ k: "color", v: "blue" }, { k: "color", v: "large" }]`
- Use cases Examples
  - Characteristics of a product
  - Rare/unpredictable fields
  - Commom characteristics
  - Set of fields all having same value type
    - List of dates
- Benefits and Trade-offs
  - Easier to index
  - Allow for non-deterministic field names
  - Ability to qualify the relationship of the original field and value
  - Reduces number of indexes

**Example**

### Extended Reference Pattern
- Problem
  - Too many repetitive joins
- Solution
  - Identify fields on the lookup side
  - Bring those fields into the main object
- Use cases Examples
  - Catalog
  - Mobile Applications
  - Reat-Time Analytics
- Benefits and Trade-offs
  - Faster reads
  - Reduce number of joins and lookups
  - May introduce lots of duplication if extended reference contains fields that mutate a lot

### Subset Pattern
- Problem
  - Working set is too big
  - Lot of pages are evicted from memory
  - A large part of documents ir rarely needed
- Solution
  - Split the collection in 2 collections
    - Most used part of documents
    - Less used part of documents
  - Duplicate part of a 1-N or N-N relationship that is often used in the most used side
- Use cases Examples
  - List of reviews for a product
  - List of comments on an article
  - List of actors in a movie
- Benefits and Trade-offs
  - Smaller working set, as often used documents are smaller
  - Shorter disk access for bringing in additional documents from the most used collection
  - More round trips to the server
  - A little more space used on disk

### Computed Pattern
- Problem
  - Costly computation or manipulation of data
  - Executed frequently on the same data, producing the same result
- Solution
  - Perform the operation and store the result in the appropiate document and collection
  - If need to redo the operations, keep the source of them
- Use cases Examples
  - Internet of things (IOT)
  - Event sourcing
  - Time series data
  - Frequent aggregation framework queries
- Benefits and Trade-offs
  - Read queries are faster
  - Saving on resources like CPU and Disk
  - May be difficult to identify the need
  - Avoid applying or overusing it unless needed

### Bucket Pattern
- Gotchas with Butcket
  - Random insertions and deletions in buckets
  - Difficult to sort across buckets
  - Ad hoc queries may be more complex, again across buckets
  - Works best when the _"complexity"_ is hidden through the application code

- Problem
  - Avoiding too many documents, or too big documents
  - A one-to-many relationship that can't be embedded
- Solution
  - Define the optimal amount of information to group together
  - Create arrays to store the information in main object
  - It is basicalle an embedded one-to-many relationship, where you get N documents, each having an average of Many/N sub documents
- Use cases Examples
  - Internet of things (IOT)
  - Data Warehouse
  - Lots of information associated to one object
- Benefits and Trade-offs
  - Good balance between number of data access and size of data returned
  - Makes data more manageable
  - Easy to prune data
  - Can lead to poor query results in not designed correctly
  - Less friendly to BI tools

### Schema Versioning Pattern
- Problem
  - Avoid downtime while doing schema upgrades
  - Upgrading all documents can take hours, days or even weeks when dealing big data
  - Don't want to update all documents
- Solution
  - Each document gets a _"schema_version"_ field
  - Application can handle all versions
  - Choose your strategy to migrate the documents
- Use cases Examples
  - Every application that use a database, deployed in production and heavily used
  - System with a lot of legacy data
- Benefits and Trade-offs
  - No downtime needed
  - Feel in control of the migration
  - Less future technical debt
  - May need two indexes for same field while in migration period

### Tree Patterns
[More information][treePatterns]

- Problem
  - Representation of hierarchical structured data
  - Different access patterns to navigate the tree
  - Provide optimized model for common operations
- Solution
  - Different patterns
    - [Child Reference][childReferences]
    - [Parent Reference][parentReferences]
    - [Array of Ancestors][arrayOfAncestors]
    - [Materialized Paths][materializedPaths]
    - [Nested Sets][nestedSets]
- Use cases Examples
  - Org Charts
  - Product Categories
- Benefits and Trade-offs
  - Child Reference
    - Easy to navigate to children nodes or tree descending access patterns
  - Parent Reference
    - Immediate parent node discovery and tree updates
  - Array of Ancestors
    - Navigate upwards on the ancestors path
  - Materialized Paths
    - Makes use of regular expressions to find nodes in the tree
  - Nested Sets
    - Provides a fast and efficient solution for finding subtrees but is inefficient for modifying the tree structure

### Polymorphic Pattern
- Problem
  - Objects more similar than different
  - Want to keep objects in same collection
- Solution
  - Field tracks the type of document or sub-document
  - Application has different code paths per document type, or has subclasses
- Use cases Examples
  - Single View
  - Product catalog
  - Content management
- Benefits and Trade-offs
  - Easier to implement
  - Allow to query across a single collection

### Approximation Pattern
- Problem
  - Data is expensive to calculate
  - It does not matter if the number is not precise
- Solution
  - Fewer, but writes with highr payload
- Use cases Examples
  - Web page counters
  - Any counters with tolerance to imprecision
  - Metric statistics
- Benefits and Trade-offs
  - Less writes
  - Less contention on documents
  - Statistically valid numbers
  - Not exact numbers
  - Must be implemented in the application

### Outlier Pattern
- Problem
  - Few documents would drive the solution
  - Impact would be negative on the majority of queries
- Solution
  - Implementation that works for majority
  - Field identifies outliers as exception
  - Outliers are handled diffrently on the application side
- Use cases Examples
  - Social networks
  - Popularity
- Benefits and Trade-offs
  - Optimized solution for most use cases
  - Differences handled application side
  - Difficult for aggregation of ad hoc queries
