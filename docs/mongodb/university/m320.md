# M320 - Data Modeling
Learn everything you need to know about data modeling for MongoDB.

## Introduction to Data Modeling
### The document model in MongoDB
- MongoDB stores data as Documents. [Document structure][documentStructure]
- Document fields can be values, embedded documents, or arrays of values and documents.
- MongoDB is a flexive Schema database.
- MongoDB documents are stored as BSON documents.
- [Supported datatypes][supportDatatypes]

Example:

```json
{
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "age": 25,
    "address": {
        "city": "Capitol",
        "state": "Moosylvania",
        "street": "One"
    },
    "phones": [
        "987654123", "389748323"
    ]
}
```


### Constraints in data modeling

- Keep the frequently used Documents in RAM
- Keep the Indexes in RAM
- Prefer SSD to HDD
- Infrequently data can use HDD
- The nature of your dataset and hardware define the need to model your data
  - It is important to identify those exact constraints and their impact to create a better model
  - As your software and the technological landscape change, your model should be re-evaluated and updated accordingly.
- Avoid [Transactions][transactions]

### Data modeling methodology diagram
- Workload
  - Data size, important reads and writes
- Relationships
  - Identify them, link or embed the related entities
- Patterns
  - Apply the ones for needed optimizations

### Identifying the workload
- Quantify and qualify the queries as much as you can.
- Few CRUD operations will drive the design.

Examples of data with their desired durability

| Type of data                      | Durability      | MongoDB notation |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Money                             | majority        | w=majority       |
| Account information               | majority        | w=majority       |
| ...anything that you can't lose   | majority        | w=majority       |
| Log data                          | one node        | w=1              |
| Sensor data                       | one node        | w=1              |
| Stock quotes, few per second data | fire and forget | w=0              |
