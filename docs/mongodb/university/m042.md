# M042 - New Features and Tools in MongoDB 4.2

## Transactions
[More info][transactions]

- Guidelines:
    1. All data modeling rules still apply
    2. Transactions should not be the most common operation
    3. Pass in the session to all statements
    4. Implement retry logic, transactions can always abort
    5. Don't unnecessarily leave snapshots open
    6. To trigger write conflicts, make sure ypu're doing writes
    7. Plan for DDL Operations

- Optimizing Sharded Transactions:
    1. Target a single shard
        - Target queries by including the shard key in your query
        - If you do not include the shard key in your query, all shards will be targeted
    2. If chunks are accessed together, collocate those chunks together
        - A chunk is a set of documents within a defined range of shard key values
        - By leveraging zones to collocate chunks, a transaction is more likely to target a single shard

## Enterprise Tools
### Atlas Data Lake
[More info][atlasDataLake]

Using Atlas Data Lake to ingest your S3 data into Atlas clusters allows you to quickly query data stored in your AWS S3 buckets using the bin.mongo shell, MongoDB Compass, and any MongoDB driver.

### Kafka Connector
[More info][kafka]

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that implements a publish-subscribe pattern to offer streams of data with a durable and scalable framework.

The MongoDB Kafka connector is a Confluent-verified connector that persists data from Kafka topics as a data sink into MongoDB as well as publishes changes from MongoDB into Kafka topics as a data source.

### Geospatial Charts
[More info][chartsGeo]

Geospatial data defines specific geographical locations, either in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates or text fields with names of geographical areas, such as countries or states. Geospatial charts combine geospatial data with other forms of data to create map-based charts.

### Charts Embedding
[More info][chartsEmbed]

As a dashboard Author, you can allow your charts to be embedded in external websites or shared via links. You can either:

- Embed an unauthenticated chart which is viewable by anyone, or
- Embed a chart which requires users to authenticate through an Embedding Authentication Provider.

## Indexes
Index key size limitations have been removed in MongoDB 4.2

### Hybrid Index Build

- One index build type.
- Motivations were the tradeoffs between performance of background and locking with foreground index builds.
- We can now build indexes quickly and without the need to lock the database.

### Wildcard Indexes
[More info][wildcard]

Allow you to dynamically create indexes on all fields or a selected subset of fields for each document in a collection.

- Useful for unpredictable workloads
- Not a replacement for traditional indexes
- Can index all fields in a collection
- Can use dot notation and wildcard projections to index a subset of fields in each document

Use Case:
    - Unpredictable query shapes
    - Attribute pattern

Syntax
```js
// Indexes all fields in a collection
db.collection.createIndex({ '$**': 1 })

// Indexes all fields in any subfield from a specific field
db.collection.createIndex({ 'field.$**': 1 })

// Indexes on multiple specific fields
db.collection.createIndex(
    { '$**': 1 },
    { "wildcardProjection": { "field1": 1, "field2.field3": 1 } }
)

// Indexes that excludes multiple specific fields
db.collection.createIndex(
    { '$**': 1 },
    { "wildcardProjection": { "field1": 0, "field2.field3": 0 } }
)
```

## Cloud/Ops Manager
### MongoDB Agent
[More Info][mongodbAgent]

Groups three agents (Automation, backup and monitoring), without the need to install three separate packages


## Security
### No passwords in config files:
- Environmental variables (__exec)
    - `mongod --config mongod.conf --configExpand "exec"`
- Web requests (__rest)
    - `mongod --config mongod.conf --configExpand "res"`

### Client-side field level encryption
[More info][clientSideEncryption]

- Encrypt data at field level
- Keys are stored in the keyvault
- Master key stored in external KMS
- Clients connect via mongocryptd

## General Improvements
### Updates Using Aggregation Pipeline
[More info][updateAggregate]

Aggregation Pipeline stages:
- $addFields
- $set
- $project
- $unset
- $replaceRoot
- $replaceWith

Example:
```js
// Old
db.collection.update({ _id: 1 }, { $inc: { a: 1 } }, { upsert: true })

// With aggregation pipeline
db.collection.update(
    { _id: 1 },
    [
        { $set: { a: { $sum: ["$a", 1] } } }
    ],
    { upsert: true }
)
```

### zstd
[Zstandard][zStandard]
[More info][mongoCompression]

- snappy (enabled by default) - very good compression, efficient use of resources
- zlib (similar to gzip) - excellent compression, but more resource intensive
- zstd - good compression and decompression, excellent compression, and efficient use of resources
